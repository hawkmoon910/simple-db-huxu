This lab focused on implementing key components of a simple database system, particularly around storage and operators.
The goal was to get hands-on experience with the internal mechanics of a DBMS, including how tuples are stored, retrieved,
inserted, deleted, and processed using relational operators. This implementation included
Filter, Predicate, Join, JoinPredicate, IntegerAggregator, StringAggregator, Aggregate, BufferPool, HeapPage, HeapFile, Insert
and Delete.

A key design decision I made was in the BufferPool eviction policy. I chose Least Recently Used (LRU). For join operations, I stuck with nested-loops join.

One useful unit test that could be added would be testing the handling of page eviction and tuple insertion when the buffer pool is full.

I didn't make changes to the API.

Nothing incomplete or missing.
